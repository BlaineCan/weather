# Weather
Ever wanted just the weather and not all that extra nonsense? Yeah, me neither. 

So what I have created is a bland page that make an api call to the weather underground api and returns your city and temperature. Not thing more.

# Running
If for whatever you would like run the damn thing, doing so is simple.
First, you'll want to clone the repo. 
```
git clone https://github.com/Whatchamazog/weather.git
```
cd into the directtory you've just created.
```
cd weather
```
Open up ```script.js``` take a peek at line 6.
```javascript
let key = //Your api key goes here;
```
NOTE:
Weather Underground does require the use of an api key. I will not provide you with one, because it is mine and I like my things.
However, it's free and you can grab one [Here](https://www.wunderground.com/)

Insert your api key in the varible called Key.
Save it and open the html file with in your favorite web browser.
```
open index.html
```
