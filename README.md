# Weather
Ever wanted just the weather and not all that extra nonsense? Yeah, me neither.

So what I have done is take out all the bells and wistles, and present you with a simple tool that takes a city name and returns the weather. Nothing more.

# Running
If for whatever reason you would like to play around with it, doing so is simple.
First, you'll want to clone the repo.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Whatchamazog/weather.git
```
cd into the directory you've just created.
```
cd weather
```
Grab all the dependencies you need
```
npm install
```
Then fire it up!
```
npm start
```
NOTE:
You will need to provide your own api key. I grabbed mine from openweather and you can too. It doesn't cost a dime and you can pick one up [here](https://openweathermap.org/).
