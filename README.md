# Weather
Ever wanted just the weather and not all that extra nonsense? Yeah, me neither. 

So what I did in my free time is build just that!
My weather app is clean, simple, and presents you with bare minimum information.

# Running
If for whatever reason you would like to play with it, doing so is simple.
First, you'll want to clone the repo. 
```
git clone https://github.com/Whatchamazog/weather.git
```
cd into the directtory you've just created.
```
cd weather
```
Install all the necessary dependencies.
```
yarn add
```
Then run the app. 
```
node index.js
```

NOTE:
The data for this project was pulled from the Open Weather Api.
If you're interested in building a like app of your own with the same service, you can get started [Here](https://openweathermap.org/appid)
